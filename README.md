My take on the annoying FizzBuzz problem. An explanation as to why this is happening can be found [here](http://braytonium.com/2013/11/05/jazzhands-tackling-the-fizzbuzz-problem/).

There will be submodules for each language with any common files being stored here in the superproject. This is generally how I structure git projects and it makes sense here.
